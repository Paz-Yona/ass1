<h2><b>about me</b></h2>
<pr id="aboutMeText">
  Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is an American singer, songwriter, actress, record producer and dancer. 
  Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. 
  She rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, 
  the group became one of the best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers 
  in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, 
  debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and earning five Grammy Awards, and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one 
  singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".
  <br>

  Following the break-up of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained her fourth 
  number-one single, "Irreplaceable", as well as the top ten singles "Déjà Vu", and "Beautiful Liar". 
  Beyoncé also continued her acting career, with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009). 
  Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008), 
  which saw the introduction of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, 
  including Song of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music 
  in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, 
  exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed eponymous album, released in 2013 with no prior announcement, 
  was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes. Her sixth album, "Lemonade" (2016), 
  also received widespread critical acclaim, with many referring to it as her most personal and political work to date, and subsequently 
  became the best-selling album of 2016. In 2018, she released Everything Is Love, a collaborative album with husband Jay-Z, as The Carters.
<br>

  Throughout her career, Beyoncé has sold over 100 million records worldwide as a solo artist, and a further 60 million records with 
  Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She is a multi-platinum, Grammy-Award studio recording 
  artist who's acclaimed for her thrilling vocals, videos, and live concert shows. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized
  Beyoncé as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade 
  and the Top Female Artist of the 2000s decade. Among numerous awards and accolades, Beyoncé has won 23 Grammy Awards and is the most 
  nominated woman in the award's history. She is also the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins, including the 
  Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. In 2008, she was and awarded the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World 
  Music Awards. In 2011, Beyoncé was presented with the inaugural Millennium Award at the Billboard Music Awards. In 2014, she became the 
  highest-paid black musician in history and was listed among Time's 100 most influential people in the world for a second year in a row. 
  Forbes ranked her as the most powerful female in entertainment on their 2015 and 2017 lists, and in 2016, she occupied the sixth place 
  for Time's Person of the Year. In 2016, she was awarded the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers 
  of America. With the release of Lemonade, Beyoncé became the first and only musical act in Billboard chart history to debut at number one 
  with their first six solo studio albums.

<h4><b>Q1</b></h4>
<br/>
<pr id="Q1">
<b>three differences between web1, web2 and web3:</b>
<br>
<b>1.</b> In Web 1.0 search engines retrieve macro contents.
Search is very fast but many times results are inaccurate or more than users can chew.
<br>
In Web 2.0 search engines retrieve tags with micro contents. The process of tagging is manual, tedious and covers negligible percents of the
WWW. Web 2.0 tags everything: pictures, links, events, news, Blogs, audio, video, and so on. Google Base even retrieves micro content texts.
<br>
In Web 3.0 search engines will hopefully retrieve micro content texts which were tagged automatically. This implies translating billions 
of Web 1.0 macro contents into micro contents. The result could be more precise search because tagging can solve part of the ambiguity
that homonyms and synonyms introduce into the process of Search.
<br>
<b>2.</b> Web 1.0 was all about static content, one way publishing of content without any real interaction between readers or publishers or each other.
<br>
Web 2.0 is more about 2 way communication through social networking, blogging, wikis, tagging, user generated content and video.
<br>
Web 3.0 is curiusly undefined. AI and the web learning what you want and delivering you a Personalized web experience.
<br>
<b>3.</b> In Web1.0 Companies publish content that people consume. 
In Web 2.0 People publish content that other people can consume, companies build platforms that let people publish content for other people.
In Web3.0 People build applications that people can interact with, companies build platforms that let people publish services by
leveraging the associations between people or special content.
